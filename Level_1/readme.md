# Level-1: OpenROAD flow Setup

## List of Objectives

- :microscope: <b>Practical Objective-1:</b> []()
  
 <div align="center">:star::star::star::star::star::star:</div> 

## :microscope: OpenROAD flow scripts installation and setup
### :zap: Clone OpenROAD-flow-scripts repository and go to the repository directory-
```bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts --depth 1
$ cd OpenROAD-flow-scripts
```
- [https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts) is the official repository which combine openroad engine with open source tools (Yosys, Klayout, OpenSTA) for RTL to GDSII flow.
- `--recursive` flag is used to clone all submodule (Else only topmodule will be cloned).
- `--depth 1` flag is used for cloning each module properly (One top module in a level at a time)

:100: OpenROAD-flow-scripts repository successfully cloned.

---

### :zap: Setup the required tools for OpenROAD-flow-scripts-
```bash
$ sudo ./setup.sh
```
- It check the dependencies if available on system or not and install if required.
- `sudo` used for overall system check for dependencies.

:100: Dependency check complete and installed the required tools.

---

### :zap: Build the OpenROAD flow-
```bash
$ ./build_openroad.sh --local --threads 1
```
- `--local` flag specify that each tool is built in respective tool directory locally.
- `--threads 1` flag used to avoid error due to parallelization when multithreading used
  - Proper building of tools are not performed during multithreading.
  - RAM for VM is around 5 GB, so memory issue occurs during multithreading.
  - Race condition occurs during multithreading.
- Linking is performed during this.

:100: OpenROAD flow script tools are built propely (binary files) but linking to OdbGtest is failed.

- For OpenROAD flow we need openroad, yosys and other tools binary file,these are built propely.
- OdbGtest is required for developers, so failure in linking to this will not cause that much problem.
